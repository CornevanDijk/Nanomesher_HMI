Combining an ESP8266 with easy to use touch screen display and leaving IO exposed, there are endless possibilities for IOT developers

Nanomesher have combined 2 excellent products - the Wemos D1 mini esp8266 based development board and the Nextion USART based touch screen display.  Both of which are affordable, easy to use and quite powerful.
